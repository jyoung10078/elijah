- National health expenditures projected to grow 8.2% in 2024 and 7.1% in 2025.
- Physician and clinical services accounted for $1.1 trillion (21%) of spending in 2024.
- By comparison, in 2000, health expenditures were ~$1.4 trillion.

3. INSURANCE COVERAGE & ACCESS

- 10 states have not fully expanded Medicaid under the ACA.
- Texas has the highest uninsured rate (16.6%); Massachusetts the lowest (2.4%).
- Hispanic Americans have the highest uninsured rates and the most cost-related barriers to care.

4. HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE CHALLENGES
- The U.S. faces growing healthcare workforce shortages driven by maldistribution of providers, burnout, and systemic issues.
- More than 122 million people lived in a Mental Health Professional Shortage Area as of December 2024.
- Physician shortages are concentrated in rural and underserved urban areas.
- Burnout, secondary trauma, and compassion fatigue are major issues across the workforce.

5. RACIAL & SOCIOECONOMIC DISPARITIES
- White populations generally receive better quality care compared to Black, Hispanic, AIAN, and AANHPI communities.
- Nonelderly AIAN, Black, Hispanic, and NHPI people are more likely to be uninsured than White counterparts.
- Unequal access to primary care is a key driver of disparities in healthcare quality.
- Hispanic people have lower premature mortality rates despite higher uninsured rates.

6. MENTAL HEALTH
- 122+ million Americans live in Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas (as of Dec 2024).
- Federal actions in 2024–2025 threaten to reduce access to mental health and substance use disorder services.
- Behavioral healthcare faces financial, structural, and policy barriers to quality access.
- Mental health parity remains an ongoing legislative and policy issue.

7. TECHNOLOGY & INNOVATION
- 71.4% of physicians reported using telehealth weekly in 2024, up from 25.1% in 2018.
- AI in U.S. healthcare market estimated at $13.26 billion in 2024, projected to grow at 36.76% CAGR.
- Generative AI solutions are being rapidly adopted across healthcare organizations.
- AI is improving diagnostics, treatment decisions, and patient care delivery.
- Telehealth has become a mainstream channel post-pandemic.

8. KEY CHALLENGES
- Rising costs far exceed inflation and GDP growth.
- Significant geographic, racial, and socioeconomic disparities in access and quality.
- Workforce shortages, especially in mental health and rural care.
- Ongoing debates around ACA sustainability, Medicaid expansion, and pharmaceutical pricing.
- Post-pandemic stress on the healthcare system structure and workforce.

9. POLICY LANDSCAPE
- The Affordable Care Act (ACA) remains central to coverage expansion.
- Medicaid expansion still incomplete in 10 states.
- Debates on drug pricing, surprise medical billing, and mental health parity continue.
- Maternal mortality rates rising, with new policy restrictions adding pressure.

=== RESEARCH: CURRENT STATE OF THE CANADIAN HEALTHCARE SYSTEM ===

--- OVERVIEW ---
- Canada's healthcare system, known as Medicare, is a publicly funded, single-payer system.
- It is governed by the Canada Health Act, guaranteeing universal coverage for hospital and physician services for citizens and permanent residents.
- The system is decentralized: provincial and territorial (PT) governments are primarily responsible for governance, regulation, co-financing, and administration.
- Canada has 13 provinces and territories, each operating its own health plan under federal standards.

--- FUNDING & SPENDING ---
- In 2024, total health care spending in Canada was estimated at $372 billion CAD.
- This represents approximately 12.4% of Canada's GDP.
- Total health care spending increased by 5.7% in 2024.
- Hospital expenditures increased by 6.1%; Drug expenditures increased by 3.8%.
- Health expenditure growth has slowed from 7.4% (2023) to 6.1% (2024).
- Public sector accounts for the largest share of health expenditure.
- Ontario's health sector spending in 2024-25: ~$91.6 billion, projected to grow at 0.7% annually.

--- KEY CHALLENGES ---
1. DOCTOR & WORKFORCE SHORTAGE
   - Ontario Medical Association reports a shortage of ~2,000 doctors.
   - About 500,000 Canadians left emergency departments in 2024 without being seen by a doctor.
   - 73% of physicians cited poor system integration or unconnected systems as major challenges (CMA 2024 survey).
   - Many Canadians lack access to a family doctor.

2. WAIT TIMES
   - Canada's public healthcare system faces persistent challenges with waiting times.
   - From April 2023 to March 2024, an estimated 28,000 patients died while waiting for surgery or a diagnostic scan.
   - The Fraser Institute's 2025 survey reports wait times for surgical/therapeutic treatments decreased slightly but remain critically high.

3. NURSING CRISIS
   - Over 50% of nurses in Canada reported feeling burnt out and had considered leaving their jobs (2024 national survey).
   - Nursing force has among the highest rates of burnout, injury, and illness.
   - COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the pre-existing nursing shortage.
   - Shortage of nursing educators and faculty in academia.
   - Many nurses are leaving the profession earlier than expected due to unsustainable working conditions.

4. HEALTH EQUITY GAPS
   - Persistent health disparities among Indigenous, Black, and racialized communities.
   - Gaps in service delivery and health outcomes for marginalized populations.
   - National pharmacare program remains in limbo — federal government not in active talks with most provinces.

5. SYSTEMIC ISSUES
   - Understaffing, poor training, and neglected triage persist.
   - Poor integration of health information systems across the country.

--- DIGITAL HEALTH & INNOVATION ---
- In 2023, the Canadian government implemented a Digital Health Strategy to enhance access to services including mental health via digital platforms.
- In June 2025, Canada Health Infoway employed AI tools to improve the healthcare system.
- 2025 marks a turning point in Canadian healthcare with increased focus on trust, governance, and digital transformation.
- CDA-AMC (formerly CADTH) releases annual Watch Lists identifying technologies to transform health systems.

--- MENTAL HEALTH ---
- Expanded investment in mental health promotion and prevention programming, including in Indigenous communities.
- Digital health platforms are being leveraged to expand mental health service access.

--- PHARMACARE ---
- Canada's public pharmacare program remains in limbo.
- The federal health minister confirmed Ottawa is not currently in active talks with remaining provinces and territories.
- Goal: Ensure every Canadian has access to essential medications and medical devices.

--- CYBERSECURITY ---
- Canada Healthcare Cybersecurity Market valued at USD 1,123.46 million in 2024.
- Expected to reach USD 2,302 million by 2030 (CAGR of 13.61%).

--- GLOBAL CONTEXT ---
- The US spent ~$14,885 per person on healthcare in 2024 — the highest per capita globally.
- Canada, while spending significantly less per capita, still ranks among higher-spending universal healthcare nations.
- Canada's universal healthcare is described as being "at a crossroads, requiring ethical reform."
